This is a small tutorial for github actions. The main components are in the .github folder under workflow. To set up the python package, click actions and start
a new workflow to configure the python package. To run tests written using pytest, you need to create a ci.yml workflow. This tells github the machine and version 
of python you are using, as well as how often it should run the tests.
